== Start with AsciiDoc

Create an AsciiDoc file with classes and ID's that work in harmony with the CSS image gallery code.

[source, AsciiDoc]
----
= ImageGallery.adoc
:docinfo1:

== The Gallery Below

[#full-picture]
* [[pic1]]link:pic1[image:610.jpg[]]
* [[pic2]]link:pic2[image:611.jpg[]]
* [[pic3]]link:pic3[image:612.jpg[]]
* [[pic4]]link:pic4[image:613.jpg[]]

[.gallery.navigation]
* link:#pic1[image:610.jpg[,width=100,]]
* link:#pic2[image:611.jpg[,width=100,]]
* link:#pic3[image:612.jpg[,width=100,]]
* link:#pic4[image:613.jpg[,width=100,]]
----

== Place all CSS in docinfo.html

Create HTML file with the following code.
This is a pure CSS image gallery.

[source, CSS]
----
<style type="text/css">
  /* http://basicuse.net/articles/pl/textile/html_css/how_to_create_a_simple_css_gallery_without_using_javascript#example */
  #gallery {
    overflow: hidden;
    position: relative;
    z-index: 1;
    margin: 100px auto;
  }
  #navigation {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    float: left;
  }
  #navigation li {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    float: left;
  }
  #navigation li a img {
    border: none;
  }

  #full-picture {
    width: 475px;
    height: 270px;
    overflow: hidden;
    float: left;
  }

  li {
    list-style: none;
  }

  #footer {
    display: none;
  }
</style>

----

At the command prompt

 $ asciidoctor imagegallery.adoc


== Open ImageGallery.html in a browser

== Images need to be the same size

IMPORTANT: Make all your images the same size so they will fit nicely in the gallery.

e.g. 1200 px X 800 px

You can adjust the size of the big image in the gallery by changing the width and height to match your final sizes in the docinfo.html file. If your images are 1200 x 800, you might want to display them at half that size by changing the CSS to be 600 x 400.

[source, CSS]
----
#full-picture { 
    width: 600px; 
    height: 400px;
    overflow: hidden; 
    float: left; 
  } 
----

NOTE: If you have 5 or 6 images you could use CSS to shrink down the thumbnail sizes to make them fit.

Instead of width=100 you could try width=75. That size is located in the AsciiDoc: 

[source, AsciiDoc]
----
[.gallery.navigation] 
* link:#pic1[image:610.jpg[,width=75,]] 
* link:#pic2[image:611.jpg[,width=75,]]
...
* link:#pic6[image:615.jpg[,width=75,]]

WARNING: this is a test.

CAUTION: test too.
